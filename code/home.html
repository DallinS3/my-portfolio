            Hi! May name is Dallin. I am from just outside Las Vegas, Nevada. I have completed my Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in Computer Information Technology (CIT), with my emphasis being Cybersecurity. I love completing work tied to Cybersecurity Analytics, Database Administration, and Scripting. I have finished my Bachelor's from Brigham Young University Idaho in Rexburg, and I am preparing to acquire my Master's degree after while working in a career field for several years.

            I love music, recreational activities, family, social engagements, and the Gospel of Christ. I am married to a beautiful young woman from Arizona and currently work full-time at Melaleuca: The Wellness Company based in Idaho Falls, ID. I have also worked in numerous positions across several companies, including on campus as a Teacher's Assistant (aka: TA) for various professors.

            I am confident my skills help me better understand how to manage a companies assests and determine the strength and integrity of their websites as an Analyst. As I deepen my understanding of programming, I will become a more valuable asset to a company and their IT department. As I improve in my knowledge and experience many of the things in the real world I have learned throughout my studies, I will aid in protecting and safeguarding many of the digital techologies used in a company.

            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since I was born, and from the time I was ten, I have had a burning testimony of the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon. One of my favorite scriptures, quoted by multiple general authorities of the Church is found in Moroni 7:45-47 ~ it speaks on the attributes and vital importance of Charity, the pure love of Jesus Christ.

            Lastly, I am an open book. Feel free to ask me questions! <br>
            I appreciate your time and attention; I thank you in advance for your comments and look forward to connecting with you.
